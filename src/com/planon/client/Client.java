/**
 * As a facility manager I do facilitate things in the office for employees which includes managers. 

People do approach me asking/requesting/complaining... 

Can I have a pen black in color //stationery
I need a board marker  //stationery
The toilet stinks //cleaning
manager: We have on-site guests visiting. I need to use board room for coming two days. And yes, take care of lunch for 5 people. //room booking, food reimbursement
Team stayed later yesterday working on a critical item. We had dinner in office. Please reimburse it. My manager told me to check with you. //food reimbursement
The cafeteria does not have enough cutlery. Please ask the maid to do the dishes on priority. //catering
My desk key is lost. I can't start my work since my laptop is inside. Please help. //workstation

---------------- 
Design a system which helps facility manager to manage things. 
An employee/manager should be able to create incident/request/reservation/complaint/etc. using the system. 
The facility manager gets an overview of what people want and pick them based on the priority which is in 
the request. and Assign staff like office boy, security, maid to it if needed.
